This is the second phone I have bought, believing they have it in stock, only to get notification at my pick-up time, that it is unavailable. Both of these items were birthday gifts that I was counting on being in-stock (and were purchased in-stock). I am so disappointed that they cannot be straight and tell me that they do not have in the store but can ship. I would have picked the shipping option and had on time if that was the case. Do not believe that you will get this item in the store, even if they advertise it that way. Shame on you Wal-Mart for false advertisement!!  :(",

I usually suck up the faulty product or bad service and move on but after what I went through today, I felt I needed to say something so no one else has to deal with what I went through today. \n\nI bought an Iphone 14 pro with this company. I made sure to purchase one that was carrier unlocked so that I may use my own carrier on my old phone to switch it over. The phone came in prefect condition physically and was free of any scratches, dents, or dings. However when I began to set up the phone I ran into several issues. \n\nFirstly, I began by logging in with my apple ID and begining to update the phone. The screen was stuck on updating for hours and took so long that I had to sit on the phone with apple for 4 hours to force restart the phone and troubleshoot the issue on their end. \n\nAfter that I called my mobile provider to transfer sims over. This is when I was told that the phone was \u201cblacklisted\u201d by verizon and was listed as lost and still had collections payments on it from verizon. I was on the phone disputing this for another 4 hours when they told me there was nothing they could do and that the phone was defective. \n\nI then reached out to Walmart who reached out to Loop Mobile because Walmart also couldn\u2019t do anything about it. This is where I was told by Loop (through email because the customer service phone number doesnt work) that I needed to repackage and return the phone to fedex. They couldn\u2019t even be bothered to process an exchange. \n\nAll in all I wasted my time and money with this company and I will not be going through that again. Their response time was horrible and they are not truthful about their product descriptions and will sell you something that straight up cannot be used. I\u2019d put zero stars if I could.",

It came in pristine shape just as the firs one, and was super easy to activate. All we had to do was plug in our existing sim card,and just like that, we had service! \nI highly recommend this product",

Did not have any bubble wrap or anything that would protect the phone when in the shipping process. \nThe phone had multiple deep scratches all over the screen very noticeable they gave no warning or caution that the phone would be that badly damaged.  \nI contacted the seller and they were very unhelpful it was a Christmas gift and I was hoping to do an exchange but they were unwilling so I returned it and got all my money back. I then took my business to amazon and they gave me exactly what I was looking for and delivered it in 2 days.",

Once checking the battery life, it showed that the battery was significantly degraded and needed service although the listing stated that it would not be below 80% \n\nVery dissatisfied. Will be returning and purchasing another phone.  \n\nAttached photos of some of the damage (was only able to post 6 pictures)",

After opening it up Christmas morning the phone looks like it has been dropped multiple times, the edges are scratched and rough. (When I say rough I do mean it will tear up your fingers.) The screen has multiple scratches on it and it is not in excellent condition. We will be returning this and it is disappointing to spend this much money and get a phone that looks worse than any of our used phones. Way to hurt my sons feelings for Christmas. That makes me even more angry.",

This is the first time I really wish I could return it and exchange it for another iPhone 13. It has so many glitches. It\u2019s unbelievable. It glitches on 80% of my apps. It actually freezes on apps and I haven\u2019t had that happen since my iPhone 5. I continually have to turn my phone off and on to get out of an app that has been frozen. I\u2019m extremely disappointed that I\u2019m stuck with a phone that works worse than the iPhone 11 that I have sitting in my drawer. I was also a little surprised that earbuds were not included, and I did purchase three phones, so I dropped quite a bit of money. But my philosophy is: It\u2019s just a thing and no one is hurt so all is well.",

I am concerned about the integrity of the screen. I guess we shall see. \n\nThe back of the phone wasn't a huge deal because a cover will be used but there was obvious signs of it being dropped multiple times. A case would have needed to be purchased anyway due to all the rough edges. \n\nThe ports and speakers are filled with dirt and debris. I feel like the seller made no effort to clean the phone at all. \n\nIn my opinion, it should have been graded as Fair and a good $75  less than it was.  Very disappointing",

This is an early birthday present to myself and definitely worth what I paid for it. This time I got 258gb. This is such a great purchase if you are on the fence about buying it i say just buy it.",

But it did come with a nick on the screen which i fear my turn into a crack, black spots all over the back under the surface (not sure how they possibly got there or if the company replaced the entire back), and the battery was at 79% considered \"needs service\" by Apple. This will cost you an extra $69 to fix before taxes from Apple and more ironically at 3rd parties They don't do exchanges, which means you'll be in limbo for awhile until they confirm receipt of the phone and Wal mart refunds your money. I needed the phone so I kept it, but I would definitely advise to buy from another seller or location. Hope this helps someone.",

This phone was packaged incorrectly as it was not with Walmart Family Mobile (SFM) as advertised. It also had a SIM card sticker label that didn't correctly match up with the SIM card itself. With all of that, it created over 16 hours worth of work on my part including hours worth of time on the phone with Tech Support to (1) transfer back to my preferred carrier of WFM and (2) to retrieve my cell phone number that I've had for decades which is essentially tied to all my work and personal apps, etc. I was giving the \"run around\" and \"circular talk\" with some reps stating they couldn't get my phone number paired back with my old phone which was obviously false as eventually a few reps worked hard to make this happen for me. Along with the time spent trying to recover my old phone and old number, I got behind with my business/work. Please make sure to be aware of what you're getting before you try the transfer process yourself with this type of phone. After more tech support with Walmart.com, I was able to eventually return the phone for a full refund. This process was truly a nightmare to deal with. I can only hope to save others the hassle and stress and encourage Walmart.com to do a better check to ensure the phones are correctly packaged as advertised with the correct phone carriers and that the labels for SIM cards match up.",

I've tried a hard reset I've restarted it many times powering it completely off while charging I haven't even had it a week very disappointed ngl, I haven't had it a week yet. I know it's a refurbished phone but i was expecting it to be better then this. It was a quick replacement phone while I was getting my phone fixed. Not sure if I can return it to store or not but I'm not very happy about it. \n\n(not a Karen I don't even tell someone they get my order wrong I just deal with it but I can't lie I'm very disappointed on this purchase)",

Did not even mention the fact that the phone goes from 100% to 10% in 2 minutes. I fully charged it. Set it up. Put it back on charge to be fully charged again. Turned it off and placed it in a box where it sat under the Christmas tree not being used\u2026 my son opened the box so excited to have a new phone, he turned it on and we sat there and watched the 100% go to 10%. Literally in a blink of an eye. Highly disappointed as this wasn't an issue that was listed.",

Some small nicks and scratches were in the phone along with a pea-size dent in the screen, but it appeared to work. Start the phone and after set up, I am immediately warned that the phone has been repaired with non-Apple parts and the phone may not function properly due to this. Here we are, two day later, and the phone is black screened. It's on as we are able to feel vibrations from the phone but the screen is gone (and yes, I did the volume up, down, and Lock Screen button, still nothing). This is after buying a cover, screen protector, etc and paying to activate this useless piece of junk. \n\nI've bought refurbished products many times and have never had an issue such as this. $750 for a paper weight. I've already started the return process for this scam and cannot wait to do my business elsewhere.",

Some small nicks and scratches were in the phone along with a pea-size dent in the screen, but it appeared to work. Start the phone and after set up, I am immediately warned that the phone has been repaired with non-Apple parts and the phone may not function properly due to this. Here we are, two day later, and the phone is black screened. It's on as we are able to feel vibrations from the phone but the screen is gone (and yes, I did the volume up, down, and Lock Screen button, still nothing). This is after buying a cover, screen protector, etc and paying to activate this useless piece of junk. \n\nI've bought refurbished products many times and have never had an issue such as this. $750 for a paper weight. I've already started the return process for this scam and cannot wait to do my business elsewhere.",

When our son told us last minute he wanted a iPhone for his birthday, we knew we wouldn't be purchasing his first iPhone as newer brand new model, so we decided to look around and we were VERY happy that we could purchase a 7, so not new and not the oldest! It was pre-owned but that's fine because it came in PERFECT like new condition! With it being last minute, it also arrived just in time within a couple days! We were very pleased. We will be ordered a couple more for our other children for Christmas :)",

I didn't have any issues returning the devices it was pretty easy and fast, just make sure you return in the  original package, it took 10 days for them to process my return and it will take another 10 days to get a full refund.",

And Night mode on every camera. iPhone 12 has it all. 5G on iPhone is superfast. So you can download movies on the fly. Stream higher-quality video. Or FaceTime in HD over cellular. With lots less lag. And you can do it in more places, because iPhone 12 has the broadest 5G coverage worldwide. A14 Bionic is the fastest chip in a smartphone. And it pushes what\u2019s possible. Like crunching trillions of operations on the Neural Engine. Or shooting in Dolby Vision \u2014 even pro movie cameras can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s superefficient for great battery life. And it\u2019s ahead of its time, prepared to power pretty much anything that comes next. Vastly more contrast. Incredible color accuracy. A huge jump in pixel density. OLED delivers brighter brights, darker blacks, and higher resolution for everything you look at. This is the best iPhone display we\u2019ve ever made, and it goes all the way to the edge. Both the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras now have Night mode \u2014 and it\u2019s better than ever at capturing incredible low-light shots. The new Wide camera brings in 27 percent more light. So whether you take photos by day or by moonlight, you\u2019ll get a level of detail and color that wasn\u2019t possible before. Night mode senses when light is low and kicks in automatically, maintaining clarity while capturing beautiful vibrant color. All you have to do is start snapping. Deep Fusion, in mid to low light, analyzes multiple exposures to maximize detail. Check out the texture in the wood, fabric, and crystal. And the Ultra Wide gets you a heroic perspective. Smart HDR 3 balances the elements in a shot, bringing out detail in the subject and trees while retaining the rich color of the sky \u2014 even at high noon. Beyond faces, Smart HDR 3 uses machine learning to recognize scenes, then adjusts sharpness, color, and white balance where needed. Even in bright light, Smart HDR 3 is amazing at capturing texture, skin tone, color saturation, and individual details that make photos feel true to life. Portrait mode is even better at artfully blurring the background to put all the focus on your subject. How do you improve on the highest-quality video in a smartphone? Make it even better in low light \u2014 a full 27 percent better. That means no hour is off limits for more beautifully detailed video. Then there\u2019s Night mode Time-lapse. Just prop up your iPhone and let the light trails begin. Now you can record 4K HDR video with Dolby Vision. Edit in Photos or iMovie. Then zap it to your TV using AirPlay to see all that color and detail. It\u2019s a start-to-finish cinematic experience \u2014 found only on iPhone. Which comes in handy when your dog does something adorable. Snap on a new MagSafe case, wallet, or both. (Fear not, the wallet is shielded so it\u2019s safe for credit cards.) Magnets align themselves perfectly every time for faster wireless charging. iOS 14 is packed with shortcuts that get you just what you want, right when you want it. iPhone is designed to protect your information. Face ID data doesn\u2019t leave your iPhone and is never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else. iOS shows you an app\u2019s privacy practices before you download it. When you use Apple Pay, your card number isn\u2019t shared with merchants. And the list goes on.\nTo charge your new iPhone, you can continue to use your USB\u2011A to Lightning cable. Or you can take advantage of fast charging with the USB\u2011C to Lightning cable now included in the box, which works with existing USB\u2011C power adapters and computer ports.",

You can barely hear someone on the phone..it's better to turn the speaker on and have a conversation in front of people. than it is to try to hear someone through the actual ear placement location.\n\nOther than.. great deal, fast shipping, I'll update later, as if the 2month mark, it does very well!",

The only issue I have with the phone is I can barely hear out of it no matter how much it's turned up no matter how many times I've tried to clean it. You can barely hear someone on the phone..it's better to turn the speaker on and have a conversation in front of people. than it is to try to hear someone through the actual ear placement location.\n\nOther than.. great deal, fast shipping, I'll update later, as if the 2month mark, it does very well!",

While opening the box I noticed a scratch in the right hand corner, luckily is wasn\u2019t as noticeable and didn\u2019t affect the screen or anything but still there. There were chips in the side of the phone and the back cameras nothing too crazy to the point where I wouldn\u2019t keep it because looks wise it\u2019s good enough. The key thing that I\u2019m sending it back for is the speakers are literally blown. My right side speaker works but it\u2019s muffled sounds like 10 years of dirt is inside of it. The left side doesn\u2019t even work at all. I understand it\u2019s used but like why would you give away a phone that has a blown speaker. Isn\u2019t that your job to fix it to sell. I\u2019m very disappointed with this purchase, transferred all of my information too it put a screen protector on it case and everything only to take it right back off and look elsewhere. Not a reliable source to buy products from. Again, understanding they are refurbished is like a chip here a scratch here not a broke piece of equipment on the phone. Save your money. Now I have to go through a whole process with sending it back and waiting for a refund. Also, I previously owned an iPhone 11 and wanted a new phone for a better speaker and my iPhone 11 was louder than what I got. I hope this can help someone else out there to not take the gamble on kiss electronics.",

If i used it to surf the web it would last less than 30min. I wasnt roaming, and I was in a good 5g coverage area. The phone had a battery health percentage of 64% right out of the box. I am going to be in contact with Walmart and the 3rd party supplier of the phone as I feel that a device being sold with a bad battery warrents a refund of what I had to spend to have the battery replaced. I purchased this device as a gift so I couldnt send it back to Walmart and await there processing time and replacement. I seriously hope that Walmart does right by this situation as they should. Be cautious when purchasing as they obviously dont throughly check what they are selling you.",

If i used it to surf the web it would last less than 30min. I wasnt roaming, and I was in a good 5g coverage area. The phone had a battery health percentage of 64% right out of the box. I am going to be in contact with Walmart and the 3rd party supplier of the phone as I feel that a device being sold with a bad battery warrents a refund of what I had to spend to have the battery replaced. I purchased this device as a gift so I couldnt send it back to Walmart and await there processing time and replacement. I seriously hope that Walmart does right by this situation as they should. Be cautious when purchasing as they obviously dont throughly check what they are selling you.",

If i used it to surf the web it would last less than 30min. I wasnt roaming, and I was in a good 5g coverage area. The phone had a battery health percentage of 64% right out of the box. I am going to be in contact with Walmart and the 3rd party supplier of the phone as I feel that a device being sold with a bad battery warrents a refund of what I had to spend to have the battery replaced. I purchased this device as a gift so I couldnt send it back to Walmart and await there processing time and replacement. I seriously hope that Walmart does right by this situation as they should. Be cautious when purchasing as they obviously dont throughly check what they are selling you.",

If i used it to surf the web it would last less than 30min. I wasnt roaming, and I was in a good 5g coverage area. The phone had a battery health percentage of 64% right out of the box. I am going to be in contact with Walmart and the 3rd party supplier of the phone as I feel that a device being sold with a bad battery warrents a refund of what I had to spend to have the battery replaced. I purchased this device as a gift so I couldnt send it back to Walmart and await there processing time and replacement. I seriously hope that Walmart does right by this situation as they should. Be cautious when purchasing as they obviously dont throughly check what they are selling you.",

Worst part, though, is the charging port either didn't work or it was also caked with \u2018gunk', not allowing the phone to charge unless you physically held the charger tightly into the phone. If you let go it would stop charging after a min or 2 and you'd have to firmly press it in again. This was a really good deal, but not at all in what was described as \u201crefurbished\u201d condition and definitely not 100% functional as described either. Im in the process of returning it, and will also need to return the screen protectors I purchased for it once they arrive as well (the delivery date has been delayed twice).

There were several pretty decent sized dings around the outside rim of the phone (especially the corners) and around both cameras lenses. The screen was super dirty and there was \u2018gunk' caked around the switch that turns the ringer on and off (listing says it was \u201cthoroughly cleaned\u201d, but it wasn't). Worst part, though, is the charging port either didn't work or it was also caked with \u2018gunk', not allowing the phone to charge unless you physically held the charger tightly into the phone. If you let go it would stop charging after a min or 2 and you'd have to firmly press it in again. This was a really good deal, but not at all in what was described as \u201crefurbished\u201d condition and definitely not 100% functional as described either. Im in the process of returning it, and will also need to return the screen protectors I purchased for it once they arrive as well (the delivery date has been delayed twice). Most of my Walmart purchasing experiences have been great; unfortunately, not this one!",

There were several pretty decent sized dings around the outside rim of the phone (especially the corners) and around both cameras lenses. The screen was super dirty and there was \u2018gunk' caked around the switch that turns the ringer on and off (listing says it was \u201cthoroughly cleaned\u201d, but it wasn't). Worst part, though, is the charging port either didn't work or it was also caked with \u2018gunk', not allowing the phone to charge unless you physically held the charger tightly into the phone. If you let go it would stop charging after a min or 2 and you'd have to firmly press it in again. This was a really good deal, but not at all in what was described as \u201crefurbished\u201d condition and definitely not 100% functional as described either. Im in the process of returning it, and will also need to return the screen protectors I purchased for it once they arrive as well (the delivery date has been delayed twice). Most of my Walmart purchasing experiences have been great; unfortunately, not this one!",

Which Walmart describes Like-New condition as the item will be fully functional with minor to no imperfections. If the item has a screen, it will have no scratches on the screen. I received a phone with significant wear, the bezel had road rash and scratches throughout. The entire screen was filled with numerous deep engraved scratches and one scratch was at least an inch in length. It's fair to say the phone was rough and had been through a few battles. Also the phone was not properly packaged for shipping it loosely rattled in the box. I emailed kiss electronics and asked for the phone to be exchanged with a phone that meets Walmart's Like-New quality description. They declined and instead blamed Walmart for incorrectly listing the phone's condition. I was then advised to contact Walmart for a refund. I've included photos which show the condition of the phone to an extent but the pictures don't do it justice you can 10x it when inspecting in person. In conclusion Walmart issued me a refund and recommended to only purchase from sellers that have earned Pro-Seller status by Walmart.",

Which Walmart describes Like-New condition as the item will be fully functional with minor to no imperfections. If the item has a screen, it will have no scratches on the screen. I received a phone with significant wear, the bezel had road rash and scratches throughout. The entire screen was filled with numerous deep engraved scratches and one scratch was at least an inch in length. It's fair to say the phone was rough and had been through a few battles. Also the phone was not properly packaged for shipping it loosely rattled in the box. I emailed kiss electronics and asked for the phone to be exchanged with a phone that meets Walmart's Like-New quality description. They declined and instead blamed Walmart for incorrectly listing the phone's condition. I was then advised to contact Walmart for a refund. I've included photos which show the condition of the phone to an extent but the pictures don't do it justice you can 10x it when inspecting in person. In conclusion Walmart issued me a refund and recommended to only purchase from sellers that have earned Pro-Seller status by Walmart.",

The rear packs a 4K video-capable \"pro 12 megapixel camera system\" with three cameras -- Ultra Wide (f/2.4 aperture, 120-degree field of view), Wide (f/1.6 aperture, sensor-shift optical image stabilization), and Telephoto (f/2.2 aperture). Apple notes that the iPhone 12 Pro Max provides \"computational photography\" features that improve low-light performance and reduce noise compared to earlier iPhone models. The iPhone 12 Pro Max uses a partially \"surgical grade\" stainless steel case with flat polished stainless steel sides and has a glass front and back. The front has a \"Ceramic Shield\" cover for improved durability and the back has an integrated \"MagSafe\" magnetic charging connection. It is splash, water, and dust-resistant to the IP68 standard (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes). Internally, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is powered by a 64-bit 3.0 GHz \"Apple A14 Bionic\" processor with six cores -- two performance cores and four high-efficiency cores -- and a 16-core Neural Engine.

I received a phone with damage and promptly reported it to the seller. The next day, I returned the phone to the Walmart store. After 2-3 days, they sent me an email stating that the return form was damaged from their website and that we couldn't refund the money due to their return policy. Despite being 4 years old, the phone was in Chinese and showed 100% battery health. It also shut down during a call. I will also report the seller to Walmart's customer care. Walmart is considering refunding my money, but they are still receiving money from the seller. Therefore, I believe Walmart should remove the seller from the pro seller category. I will continue to update this review every week to raise awareness about this scam and prevent others from falling victim to it",

I received a phone with damage and promptly reported it to the seller. The next day, I returned the phone to the Walmart store. After 2-3 days, they sent me an email stating that the return form was damaged from their website and that we couldn't refund the money due to their return policy. Despite being 4 years old, the phone was in Chinese and showed 100% battery health. It also shut down during a call. I will also report the seller to Walmart's customer care. Walmart is considering refunding my money, but they are still receiving money from the seller. Therefore, I believe Walmart should remove the seller from the pro seller category. I will continue to update this review every week to raise awareness about this scam and prevent others from falling victim to it",

After 2-3 days, they sent me an email stating that the return form was damaged from their website and that we couldn't refund the money due to their return policy. Despite being 4 years old, the phone was in Chinese and showed 100% battery health. It also shut down during a call. I will also report the seller to Walmart's customer care. Walmart is considering refunding my money, but they are still receiving money from the seller. Therefore, I believe Walmart should remove the seller from the pro seller category.

For one thing, it doesn\u2019t have 5G access. Just 4G/LTE, but no big deal if you\u2019re not picky about 5G. However, my main complaint is the battery life.

I went to customer service to return and was given a receipt with a tracking %23.  When I entered the tracking %23 on Fedex, it said that number did not exist.  I am very disappointed with my entire purchase.

I reached out to the seller and experienced some of the worst customer service I've ever encountered. My Walmart account tells me that it is returnable for 3 months. When I reached out to the seller to see how they could make it right, the told me I only had 30 days and I was two days past that, if I attempted to return it they would block Walmart from returning my money. \nBottom line, I don't think anyone should do business with this seller. Read the reviews, there are many who have had the same experience.",

You'd be watching it begin the updating process and then it would shut off and begin to reload like you'd just cut the phone on. Ended up having to send it back! What else could I do with it?

I took it to cellphone store in Walmart and was told it could not remove information because the buttons were not working.  I went to customer service to return and was given a receipt with a tracking %23.  When I entered the tracking %23 on Fedex, it said that number did not exist.  I am very disappointed with my entire purchase.  I thought I was getting a cellphone from Walmart, only to find out it was from Marketplace and it could take up to ten business days before I get a refund (that's if I ever get one).",

I reached out to the seller and experienced some of the worst customer service I've ever encountered. My Walmart account tells me that it is returnable for 3 months. When I reached out to the seller to see how they could make it right, the told me I only had 30 days and I was two days past that, if I attempted to return it they would block Walmart from returning my money. \nBottom line, I don't think anyone should do business with this seller. Read the reviews, there are many who have had the same experience.",

It kept going off every few minutes when you tried to use it. Someone told me to try to update it and that may solve the problem. It wouldn't stay on long enough to take the update. You'd be watching it begin the updating process and then it would shut off and begin to reload like you'd just cut the phone on. Ended up having to send it back! What else could I do with it? Definitely was a waste of time and money! Sad part is, this is my first experience with using this seller.

They said it would be here next day and it didn't get here until a week and a half later. I did get the phone and I do understand it's refurbished but the charger port is not holding the charger as it should be. The phone battery is at 83% usually a refurbished phone can get pushed up to 100%. That's probably why they gave us the wireless charger because the charger port is loser than it should be. \n\nOn the brighter side everything else is great",

They said it would be here next day and it didn't get here until a week and a half later. I did get the phone and I do understand it's refurbished but the charger port is not holding the charger as it should be. The phone battery is at 83% usually a refurbished phone can get pushed up to 100%. That's probably why they gave us the wireless charger because the charger port is loser than it should be. \n\nOn the brighter side everything else is great",

The phone acknowledged that the camera wasn't authentic, which I was slightly annoyed with on setup but figured it's refurbished, that's why the replaced camera. But then on setup, the camera lens still had a crack in it which shows up in every picture and makes it impossible to deposit checks via mobile deposit because the crack shows up over the capture. The rest of the phone is fine, so that's why I rated it as two stars but it's annoying to buy a phone that should be good to go, only to find out it still needs to have repairs done.",

But then on setup, the camera lens still had a crack in it which shows up in every picture and makes it impossible to deposit checks via mobile deposit because the crack shows up over the capture. The rest of the phone is fine, so that's why I rated it as two stars but it's annoying to buy a phone that should be good to go, only to find out it still needs to have repairs done.",

The phone kept giving me a notification that the camera may not work properly because it was repaired by someone other than Apple, but the camera works perfectly and I was able to figure out how to dismiss the notification. :)  9/10 experience just because of the notification issue.",

It was taking it forever to charge, but I needed a phone as mine had stopped working. I switched everything over and then plugged it back to the charger. Overnight, it barely made it to 90% after being on the charger not being used for 12  hours. On my 1 hour commute to work, the battery went from 90% to 54ish within that hour and that phone had not been used. I tried to plug it up to my charger at work and it showed it was charging, but the battery life continued to drop. I even went and bought a new charger with the hopes it would work. It didn't and it kept on dropping. At this point, I thought maybe it would be best to power off the phone and let it charge for a while that way. When I turned the phone back on, the screen wouldn't work and there was less charge to the phone than at the time i powered it off. If I had to take a guess, the phone has probably never been refurbished as stated, and was just repackage to quickly sell. I instantly started the refund process and will be taking the phone back to my local Wal-Mart ASAP. Luckily, I was able to find the same phone through Straight Talk, brand new, for not much more than the price for this one. I was able to get free shipping as well and have it to me within 1-2 days.",

It was taking it forever to charge, but I needed a phone as mine had stopped working. I switched everything over and then plugged it back to the charger. Overnight, it barely made it to 90% after being on the charger not being used for 12  hours. On my 1 hour commute to work, the battery went from 90% to 54ish within that hour and that phone had not been used. I tried to plug it up to my charger at work and it showed it was charging, but the battery life continued to drop. I even went and bought a new charger with the hopes it would work. It didn't and it kept on dropping. At this point, I thought maybe it would be best to power off the phone and let it charge for a while that way. When I turned the phone back on, the screen wouldn't work and there was less charge to the phone than at the time i powered it off. If I had to take a guess, the phone has probably never been refurbished as stated, and was just repackage to quickly sell. I instantly started the refund process and will be taking the phone back to my local Wal-Mart ASAP. Luckily, I was able to find the same phone through Straight Talk, brand new, for not much more than the price for this one. I was able to get free shipping as well and have it to me within 1-2 days.",

Their customer service/support is not helpful and they are rude and snappy when answering basic questions that someone would have. 0/10 recommend this company",

How can the seller ask me after the fact if I purchased the phone by accident and that their vendors do not offer bundles? WHY IS THIS LISTED THEN, TAKE IT DOWN! Very dissatisfied customer. Will not shop through Walmart no more. In the description it says the color red! Not black\u2026.",

They sent IPhone 14 Pro. Smaller less expensive phone! No refund in price difference($300 ) No explanation! No way to talk to anyone there. They pass the Buck. Finally after 2weeks had to return (wrong) phone for refund instead of exchange to Walmart! WM even contacted them to email me but nothing from them (Network Stores chg \u2018d name to Paradigm) Probably bc of complaints! Make sure your goods are coming from WM not 3rd party. Third party services don't care once they get your money !! Would have left a negative review NOT for Walmart but Network Stores in Bolton Mass but wasn't offered\ud83d\ude21",

They sent IPhone 14 Pro. Smaller less expensive phone! No refund in price difference($300 ) No explanation! No way to talk to anyone there. They pass the Buck. Finally after 2weeks had to return (wrong) phone for refund instead of exchange to Walmart! WM even contacted them to email me but nothing from them (Network Stores chg \u2018d name to Paradigm) Probably bc of complaints! Make sure your goods are coming from WM not 3rd party. Third party services don't care once they get your money !! Would have left a negative review NOT for Walmart but Network Stores in Bolton Mass but wasn't offered\ud83d\ude21",

They sent IPhone 14 Pro. Smaller less expensive phone! No refund in price difference($300 ) No explanation! No way to talk to anyone there. They pass the Buck. Finally after 2weeks had to return (wrong) phone for refund instead of exchange to Walmart! WM even contacted them to email me but nothing from them (Network Stores chg \u2018d name to Paradigm) Probably bc of complaints! Make sure your goods are coming from WM not 3rd party. Third party services don't care once they get your money !! Would have left a negative review NOT for Walmart but Network Stores in Bolton Mass but wasn't offered\ud83d\ude21",

While it's not a major problem and the phone still lasts through a full day of use, I was hoping for better battery health. That said, it's a minor concern and doesn't take away from how satisfied I am with the device overall.",

While it's not a major problem and the phone still lasts through a full day of use, I was hoping for better battery health. That said, it's a minor concern and doesn't take away from how satisfied I am with the device overall.",

Finally after 2weeks had to return (wrong) phone for refund instead of exchange to Walmart! WM even contacted them to email me but nothing from them (Network Stores chg \u2018d name to Paradigm) Probably bc of complaints! Make sure your goods are coming from WM not 3rd party. Third party services don't care once they get your money !! Would have left a negative review NOT for Walmart but Network Stores in Bolton Mass but wasn't offered\ud83d\ude21",

What is this i  spend$554.20 and I receive worthless product so I do first return the return return policy. You have to pack on the box with the bubble run I did also I spent $15 also for the bubble wrap in box before I check there is no screen blockage in company say I am broke the screen, when I received product, I am only check the battery life. The battery life is poor. That's why I returned the product now. Company say I am not giving you money back. They told me you break the screen in this scene. I am not use her phone so how broke I don't know. It is probably transportation Problem I am never buy any product on this company particular company. Thank you so much.",

Theirs some cosmetic defects such as some scratches along the sides of the phone, they are more like knicks and are about 1cm not a bunch and not big at all. There is none in the screen or back glass or camera. The phone is fully functional and clean as well as running very smoothly (wrote on day 2 of using new phone). It had a 87% battery life when I got it. For a used iPhone 13 Pro at $500.00 this is a steal. Don't expect it to be perfect it's been used. But it's been refurbished pretty well. Do expect minor cosmetic defects and the battery health to not be super good it's not like I bought a brand new phone out of box. I'm giving it 4/5 only because I wish the battery health was at least 90%. But for the price I can't complain!",

What is this i  spend$554.20 and I receive worthless product so I do first return the return return policy. You have to pack on the box with the bubble run I did also I spent $15 also for the bubble wrap in box before I check there is no screen blockage in company say I am broke the screen, when I received product, I am only check the battery life. The battery life is poor. That's why I returned the product now. Company say I am not giving you money back. They told me you break the screen in this scene. I am not use her phone so how broke I don't know. It is probably transportation Problem I am never buy any product on this company particular company. Thank you so much.",

Theirs some cosmetic defects such as some scratches along the sides of the phone, they are more like knicks and are about 1cm not a bunch and not big at all. There is none in the screen or back glass or camera. The phone is fully functional and clean as well as running very smoothly (wrote on day 2 of using new phone). It had a 87% battery life when I got it. For a used iPhone 13 Pro at $500.00 this is a steal. Don't expect it to be perfect it's been used. But it's been refurbished pretty well. Do expect minor cosmetic defects and the battery health to not be super good it's not like I bought a brand new phone out of box. I'm giving it 4/5 only because I wish the battery health was at least 90%. But for the price I can't complain!",

And Night mode on every camera. iPhone 12 has it all. 5G on iPhone is superfast. So you can download movies on the fly. Stream higher-quality video. Or FaceTime in HD over cellular. With lots less lag. And you can do it in more places, because iPhone 12 has the broadest 5G coverage worldwide. A14 Bionic is the fastest chip in a smartphone. And it pushes what\u2019s possible. Like crunching trillions of operations on the Neural Engine. Or shooting in Dolby Vision \u2014 even pro movie cameras can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s superefficient for great battery life. And it\u2019s ahead of its time, prepared to power pretty much anything that comes next. Vastly more contrast. Incredible color accuracy. A huge jump in pixel density. OLED delivers brighter brights, darker blacks, and higher resolution for everything you look at. This is the best iPhone display we\u2019ve ever made, and it goes all the way to the edge. Both the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras now have Night mode \u2014 and it\u2019s better than ever at capturing incredible low-light shots. The new Wide camera brings in 27 percent more light. So whether you take photos by day or by moonlight, you\u2019ll get a level of detail and color that wasn\u2019t possible before. Night mode senses when light is low and kicks in automatically, maintaining clarity while capturing beautiful vibrant color. All you have to do is start snapping. Deep Fusion, in mid to low light, analyzes multiple exposures to maximize detail. Check out the texture in the wood, fabric, and crystal. And the Ultra Wide gets you a heroic perspective. Smart HDR 3 balances the elements in a shot, bringing out detail in the subject and trees while retaining the rich color of the sky \u2014 even at high noon. Beyond faces, Smart HDR 3 uses machine learning to recognize scenes, then adjusts sharpness, color, and white balance where needed. Even in bright light, Smart HDR 3 is amazing at capturing texture, skin tone, color saturation, and individual details that make photos feel true to life. Portrait mode is even better at artfully blurring the background to put all the focus on your subject. How do you improve on the highest-quality video in a smartphone? Make it even better in low light \u2014 a full 27 percent better. That means no hour is off limits for more beautifully detailed video. Then there\u2019s Night mode Time-lapse. Just prop up your iPhone and let the light trails begin. Now you can record 4K HDR video with Dolby Vision. Edit in Photos or iMovie. Then zap it to your TV using AirPlay to see all that color and detail. It\u2019s a start-to-finish cinematic experience \u2014 found only on iPhone. Which comes in handy when your dog does something adorable. Snap on a new MagSafe case, wallet, or both. (Fear not, the wallet is shielded so it\u2019s safe for credit cards.) Magnets align themselves perfectly every time for faster wireless charging. iOS 14 is packed with shortcuts that get you just what you want, right when you want it. iPhone is designed to protect your information. Face ID data doesn\u2019t leave your iPhone and is never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else. iOS shows you an app\u2019s privacy practices before you download it. When you use Apple Pay, your card number isn\u2019t shared with merchants. And the list goes on. To charge your new iPhone, you can continue to use your USB\u2011A to Lightning cable. Or you can take advantage of fast charging with the USB\u2011C to Lightning cable now included in the box, which works with existing USB\u2011C power adapters and computer ports.",

And Night mode on every camera. iPhone 12 has it all. 5G on iPhone is superfast. So you can download movies on the fly. Stream higher-quality video. Or FaceTime in HD over cellular. With lots less lag. And you can do it in more places, because iPhone 12 has the broadest 5G coverage worldwide. A14 Bionic is the fastest chip in a smartphone. And it pushes what\u2019s possible. Like crunching trillions of operations on the Neural Engine. Or shooting in Dolby Vision \u2014 even pro movie cameras can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s superefficient for great battery life. And it\u2019s ahead of its time, prepared to power pretty much anything that comes next. Vastly more contrast. Incredible color accuracy. A huge jump in pixel density. OLED delivers brighter brights, darker blacks, and higher resolution for everything you look at. This is the best iPhone display we\u2019ve ever made, and it goes all the way to the edge. Both the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras now have Night mode \u2014 and it\u2019s better than ever at capturing incredible low-light shots. The new Wide camera brings in 27 percent more light. So whether you take photos by day or by moonlight, you\u2019ll get a level of detail and color that wasn\u2019t possible before. Night mode senses when light is low and kicks in automatically, maintaining clarity while capturing beautiful vibrant color. All you have to do is start snapping. Deep Fusion, in mid to low light, analyzes multiple exposures to maximize detail. Check out the texture in the wood, fabric, and crystal. And the Ultra Wide gets you a heroic perspective. Smart HDR 3 balances the elements in a shot, bringing out detail in the subject and trees while retaining the rich color of the sky \u2014 even at high noon. Beyond faces, Smart HDR 3 uses machine learning to recognize scenes, then adjusts sharpness, color, and white balance where needed. Even in bright light, Smart HDR 3 is amazing at capturing texture, skin tone, color saturation, and individual details that make photos feel true to life. Portrait mode is even better at artfully blurring the background to put all the focus on your subject. How do you improve on the highest-quality video in a smartphone? Make it even better in low light \u2014 a full 27 percent better. That means no hour is off limits for more beautifully detailed video. Then there\u2019s Night mode Time-lapse. Just prop up your iPhone and let the light trails begin. Now you can record 4K HDR video with Dolby Vision. Edit in Photos or iMovie. Then zap it to your TV using AirPlay to see all that color and detail. It\u2019s a start-to-finish cinematic experience \u2014 found only on iPhone. Which comes in handy when your dog does something adorable. Snap on a new MagSafe case, wallet, or both. (Fear not, the wallet is shielded so it\u2019s safe for credit cards.) Magnets align themselves perfectly every time for faster wireless charging. iOS 14 is packed with shortcuts that get you just what you want, right when you want it. iPhone is designed to protect your information. Face ID data doesn\u2019t leave your iPhone and is never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else. iOS shows you an app\u2019s privacy practices before you download it. When you use Apple Pay, your card number isn\u2019t shared with merchants. And the list goes on. To charge your new iPhone, you can continue to use your USB\u2011A to Lightning cable. Or you can take advantage of fast charging with the USB\u2011C to Lightning cable now included in the box, which works with existing USB\u2011C power adapters and computer ports.",

I connected my e sim and it disconnects because the hardware need to be replaced or something. I also tried every  method to fix the problem of connecting to cellular.It also came with some scratches already on the phone the sides of the phone are scuffed and the top left  corner is dented in a weird way that it pokes out is hardly noticeable at all until you inspect it !! Now I have to go to my carrier and put my eSIM back on my old phone because this phone caused my e sim to disappear! It's best to buy a pre owned iPhone in person than online because you can see if the phone is ok with everything!",

Now i ordered my phones unlocked so that i can easily transfer my xfinity mobile service over, as well as my daughters, and for some reason it shows up as still locked when xfinity tried activating. But when we look up the imei all that it clearly says unlocked not black listed has been paid in full . I ended up trying to just put my old sim into the new phone and so far it has worked! So i'm not sure what xfinity meant. However so far so good as far as quality carrier",

It's best to buy a pre owned iPhone in person than online because you can see if the phone is ok with everything!",

But when we look up the imei all that it clearly says unlocked not black listed has been paid in full . I ended up trying to just put my old sim into the new phone and so far it has worked!
